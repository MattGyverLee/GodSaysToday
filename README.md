### Paratext 8 Manuals

The Paratext 8 Manuals are a set of training resources at Supporter, Translator, and Consultant Level. They are intended for self-study or training courses and guide the user through tasks from starting Paratext to pre-typesetting. They are constantly updated and available in both web-accessible (wiki) and Printable (PDF) versions for your convenience.
